# Java Selenium Automation Project

Hi, This Project is Java based Automation Project.
In this project I have used tools/technologies like Java, Selenium, TestNg, and ExtentReports.

**Java** - Programming Language  
**Selenium** - Automation framework  
**TestNg** - Testing framework  
**ExtentReports** - It will generate HTML report

Selenium is most underrated framework. By using Selenium we can automate daily routine tasks, etc. which reduces manual efforts.
